    <p>I'm a huge fan of linguistics, many thanks to an academic summer camp
    a few years back that got me absolutely hooked. I have
    gone on to take many classes at Columbia with respect to this subject, as well
    as creating my own ConLang (constructed language) and writing a couple of
    papers as part of assignments.</p> <br>

        <h2>Field Methods: Balti</h2>
        <h4>Spring 2020</h4>
        <p>As part of the Language Documentation: Field Methods course taught by Dr. Meredith Landman,
          I got the chance to work on an endangered language from the ground up. The language that the
          class worked on for the semester was Balti, a Tibetic language spoken in the Kashmiri region
          of Pakistan. Below are the three papers that I wrote for the course. If you want to look
          at the final class product, several students worked through the summer as well to create a
          comprehensive Balti dictionary. <br><br>

        <h2>Russian [i] vs. [ɨ] distinction</h2>
        <h4>Spring 2020</h4>
        <p>During the Phonetics and Phonology class taught by Dr. Meredith Landman, I wrote a paper
          on Russian's [i] vs. [ɨ] distinction in English. My informants were two Russian-speaking relatives, whom
          I call Speaker 1 and Speaker 2. Using Praat, I analyzed
          recordings of both informants reading from a list of Russian and English words containing [i] and [ɪ]
          to see how they would pronounce them, to determine what a native Russian speaker would consider a
          phoneme in foreign words. The result is that the [i] vs. [ɨ] distinction exists in English, but
          [i] vs. [ɪ] distinction does not exist for Russian speakers.
        </p>
        <p>An interesting difference is that because
        Speaker 1 learned to speak English and not just read it, when she is made aware of this English distinction
        she intentionally tries to pronounce it with the proper pronunciation, while Speaker 2 cannot distinguish
        the two sounds even after being made aware of there being a difference in English.

        <h2>Thabulou</h2>
        <h4>Summer 2015</h4>
        <p>As part of the Linguistics course I took in Summer 2015 from Johns Hopkins Center for
          Talented Youth, one of our ongoing assignments during the three
        weeks were to create a language from scratch, or a "ConLang". It could have any features
      that we wanted and its creation was used to test our learning throughout the course. It is unfinished
      in many ways, as it was done during three weeks and then I only worked on it for a little bit of time afterwards,
      but it was one of my favorite assignments to work on.</p>
      <p> The result is a language that works similar to English in the sense that it is SVO,
        and it has its own working alphabet and grammar. The most underworked part is the vocabulary, as it is actually
        a bit difficult to make up words that don't sound like any words you know (which was my goal at the time).
        It is not able to be used for practical purposes either, as the words that I have come up with over the years
        are not from the Swadish list and instead are just words that I thought would be potentially useful at the time.
