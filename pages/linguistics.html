    <h1>Linguistics</h1>

    <p>I'm a huge fan of linguistics, many thanks to an academic summer camp
    (shoutout to CTY!) a few years back that got me absolutely hooked. I have
    gone on to take many classes at Columbia with respect to this subject, as well
    as creating my own ConLang (constructed language) and writing a couple of
    papers as part of assignments.</p> <br>

    <h3>My projects/papers/the like:</h3>
    <li>Thabulou - a ConLang by a person whose entire concept of language was just English <br><br>
    <li>PhonPhon - Russian [I] vs. [i] distinction in nonnative English speakers <br><br>
    <li>Balti - multiple papers done as part of a Language Documentation:
      Field Methods course, taught by the wonderful Dr. Meredith Landman <br><br>
