    (disregard the "Aerospace Fellowship" portion and title, the rest holds up pretty well.)


    <p>I am a recent graduate of the Columbia University School of
      Engineering and Applied Sciences, where I studied Computer Science and Linguistics
      with some aerospace on the side. However, I'd venture to say that I am just a
      tad more than that. </p>
