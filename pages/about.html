    (disregard the "Aerospace Fellowship" portion and title, the rest holds up pretty well.)


    <p>I am a senior in the Columbia University School of
      Engineering and Applied Sciences, studying Computer Science and Linguistics,
      with some aerospace on the side. However, I'd venture to say that I am just a
      tad more than that. </p>
