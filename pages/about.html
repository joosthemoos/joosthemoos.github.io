     (disregard the "Aerospace Fellowship" portion and title, the rest holds up pretty well.)
    <p>I am a junior in the Columbia University School of
      Engineering and Applied Sciences, studying Computer Science and Linguistics,
      with some aerospace on the side. However, I'd venture to say that I am just a
      tad more than that. </p>

    <h3>Things I am currently involved with:</h3>

      <b><i>Quantum Numerics AG </b></i><br>
        I am a Research and Development Intern, where I am working on n-body simulations
        for satellite traffic management.<br>
      <b><i>Columbia Space Initiative</b></i><br>
        I am the Co-President and am also a member of the Rocketry mission,
        where I primarily work on the nose cone as part of the Airframe subteam.<br>
      <b><i>Columbia GLOT </b></i><br>
        GLOT, or the Group of Linguistically-Oriented Terrestrials, is a language
        and linguistics club that I co-founded with a friend in fall 2019. Currently,
        I am the Secretary.<br>
      <b><i>Columbia University Wind Ensemble</b></i><br>
        I am currently Vice President, and I play bass clarinet.<br>
      <b><i>Columbia Pops Orchestra</b></i><br>
        I play bass clarinet here as well. It's a really good instrument.<br>
