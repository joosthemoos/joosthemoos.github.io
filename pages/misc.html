      <h2>Learning what a "static website" means</h2>
      <h4>January 2022</h4>
      <p>Languages/toolkits used: HTML, JQuery, probably something else</p>
      <img src="misc_projects/rip_static_websites.png" width="1000" height="450" alt="What things would have looked like, sort of.">
      <p>Ah, how the mighty have fallen! In an attempt to personalize my website, I have had some
        ups, some downs, and now a complete full-stop to a project I had been hoping to implement.
      </p>
      <p>I have recently been using this wonderful scrobbler called LastFM(found at last.fm) to track my music taste.
      For those unfamiliar, a scrobbler is a program that scrapes your specified music-streaming services and
      tracks the songs. LastFM also gives you data on the genre, how your listening has changed over time, and
      other truly excellent statistics.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of my website's homepage, I really wanted to add a section showing my most recently listened-to
        song - however, I had no idea how to implement this. A couple of hours later learning about how JQuery handles
        HTTP requests and much trial and error parsing the XML file that LastFM returns, I got it! I had done it (picture
        evidence shown above! I know I know, I could have just written "Yeah Right by Joji" and you would never have known
        the difference, but <a href="misc_projects/lastfm_last_played.txt" target="_blank">please believe me</a>). So, success, right? WRONG!
      </p>
      <p>This is where GitHub Pages comes in. All is fine and well, it works locally, and I commit the code - and it doesn't
      work in production. A quick Google Search tells me that GitHub Pages <i>cannot handle GET and PUT requests.</i> A TRAGEDY!</p>
      <p>Was it all for naught? Potentially. Even if I did not get to actually implement it, what a fun project it was! It really makes
      me think about what kind of websites I actually can create for myself, should I want to ever pay for a non-static website. I most
      likely would want a website with a more aesthetically-pleasing implementation of my LastFM data - maybe even an embedded website
      displaying some interesting visualization from another website; maybe I will add some kind of nice visuals of my own, perhaps a photo
      gallery? Who knows what the future holds!</p>

      <h2>Retractable Poi</h2>
      <h4>Spring 2020</h4>
      <p>During Spring of 2020, I took a Computer Graphics and Design course, which
        was retrospectively one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. I have
        worked with CAD a lot over the years for various projects, but I have never
        had any formal training. Taught by Dr. Yesilevskiy, I learned valuable skills
        for modeling all sorts of objects and I got hands-on experience that
        still helps me to this day.
      </p>
      <p>The best part of this class was the final project, where we were simply told
        to "find a problem in the world and fix it" with some kind of product.
        I decided to focus on the flow arts, a subset of performing arts that
         uses props that are swung, thrown, or spun. I more specifically focused on poi,
         which are at a very basic level balls on strings that can be spun or thrown.
      </p>
      <p>Because typical poi spinners perform in often weird locations, it is a common
        problem that they get lost or stolen, and because they are usually very expensive
        (a pair of programmable LED poi can cost upwards of $220 USD), it can cause
        financial burden on the spinner. I decided to remedy this problem by making
        retractable poi that can be worn on the arm, then extended during spinning,
        and then retracted later. It was a challenge to model, especially modeling
        fabric, but it ended up being a product I was very proud of!
      </p>
      <p>For a clearer description of its purpose, design, and
        function, check out my proposal <a href="misc_projects/CAD Final Project Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br>For some of the CAD files,
        check out my GrabCAD here. Below is the (admittedly very not-serious)
        pitch video that we were also tasked with creating!
