      <h2>Accidentally deriving somewhat the moving-average algorithm + flight computer fiasco</h2>
      <h4>June 2022</h4>
      <p>Languages/toolkits used: Multigrain Cheerios and a Ramada notepad (and C++?)</p>
      <p>
        At the Spaceport America Cup in 2022 (Check "Space" for a better overview), we ran into more than 
        a few problems - quite a few, actually. One of them was that we had not realized that the flight 
        computer that we had created ourselves (the SRAD one, or "Student-Researched and Designed"), was 
        not fully programmed. The goal of the flight computer is to manage our dual-deployment recovery 
        system which consisted of a drogue chute deploying at apogee (the max. altitude of the flight) and 
        a larger main chute deploying at 1500ft. The flight computer can detect this in a multitude of ways
        primarily by using a barometer/thermometer combo for altitude reading and a gyroscope for 
        acceleration reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this sensor data is noisy - if you want to detect apogee, for example, you dont want to count 
        an accidental spike in the reading as the maximum apogee, risking deploying the drogue chute on the way 
        up. How do you correct for this error? The person who had written the code used a Madgwick filter 
        but for one I wasn't sure that it would perfectly smooth everything (I couldn't get a guaranteed yes 
        on that one) and for two we for some reason decided to use Arduino Nanos which have almost no storage,
        and the library for the filter was very large. I had to think of a way to preserve past data trends 
        while being able to overlook significant outliers and not weight them greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter Cheerios. I set up a model of a slightly noisy sensor reading by modeling with piles of Cheerios 
        that generally increased then decreased in amounts. My first step was to keep the past x sensor readings 
        in a list, and then check in between each of those sensor readings if Cheerio pile x+1 had a greater or 
        less amount of Cheerios than pile x. However, this still weights outliers too greatly - what if you have
        a BUNCH of large Cheerio piles? You are basically relying way too much on the arbitrary size of the array 
        that you are creating to make sure that the average increase/decrease detection is not swayed by bad data.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why not use the average of the system at a given time? In this setup, you have two arrays. The first 
        array is the one we talked about which just has the past x sensor readings. The other array is now full of 
        x/2 averages of the first array at every given state. Say, for example, that you have an array [0,0,0,0,0,1] 
        of sensor readings and then the other array would be [0,0,1/6] of current averages. This method bakes in 
        previous knowledge already by having the moving average, and you can even go one degree higher by doing 
        what we were attempting to do before and look at increasing/decreasing patterns - this time with the array 
        of state averages. This successfully overlooks large data spikes or non-continuing trends and though you 
        sacrifice several timesteps as the system state fully clears up for you to deploy the drogue, it is 
        more important to be conservative in this case and deploy it late than deploy on the way up.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, turns out this is called the moving-average algorithm, and it is a common signals-processing technique. 
        Only learned that afterwards but, heyo! Maybe if I were a mathematician in the 1800's I could have made a 
        name for myself and it would be called the Kuleshov algorithm or something corny like that.

      <h2>I made a Linguistics minor in the Columbia School of Engineering!</h2>
      <h4>Fall 2019 - Spring 2022</h4>
      <p>
        Man, this was a long time coming and it took way too long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since I took a Linguistics class at CTY I have always wanted to study Linguistics in some capacity - however, when I 
        got into the Columbia engineering school, I realized that I would not get any credit for taking the Linguistics classes that 
        I was going to take regardless. I was told very quickly after coming to Columbia that minors can be made and look! They weren't 
        even made that long ago! So you can make one too, Jess! I was really, really naive to think that was the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started honestly working towards a minor in December 2019 after the major had been passed in the College, 
        which then people in the administration procrastinated on responding to me about until Covid 
        hit and the Engineering Student Council president told me that they no longer would be working. It was then on hiatus until junior 
        year, where I worked with the next ESC president on getting it presented to ESC, which was successful. The next step was presenting 
        the plan of classes to the SEAS Committee on Instruction, or COI, comprised of professors and other staff who would be really my 
        final barrier to making this a reality. I did not get the chance to do this until December of 2021, and I had to get the 
        curriculum vetted multiple times before it finally passed through there. In the interim, somehow the Computer Science department 
        was placed in charge of passing the minor and I (and everybody, it seems) lost track of who was actually responsible for 
        doing the work to get this passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After many emails, pinging, CC'ing and general back-and-forth it passed! I managed to get it just in time for graduation and get 
        it into the aging backend of Columbia's transcript system to get people at least some recognition for taking the courses they had 
        been taking all along. This was a logistical hell and I am so glad to be out of it.

      <h2>Learning what a "static website" means</h2>
      <h4>January 2022</h4>
      <p>Languages/toolkits used: HTML, JQuery, probably something else</p>
      <img src="misc_projects/rip_static_websites.png" width="1000" height="450" alt="What things would have looked like, sort of.">
      <p>Ah, how the mighty have fallen! In an attempt to personalize my website, I have had some
        ups, some downs, and now a complete full-stop to a project I had been hoping to implement.
      </p>
      <p>I have recently been using this wonderful scrobbler called LastFM(found at last.fm) to track my music taste.
      For those unfamiliar, a scrobbler is a program that scrapes your specified music-streaming services and
      tracks the songs. LastFM also gives you data on the genre, how your listening has changed over time, and
      other truly excellent statistics.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of my website's homepage, I really wanted to add a section showing my most recently listened-to
        song - however, I had no idea how to implement this. A couple of hours later learning about how JQuery handles
        HTTP requests and much trial and error parsing the XML file that LastFM returns, I got it! I had done it (picture
        evidence shown above! I know I know, I could have just written "Yeah Right by Joji" and you would never have known
        the difference, but <a href="misc_projects/lastfm_last_played.txt" target="_blank">please believe me</a>). So, success, right? WRONG!
      </p>
      <p>This is where GitHub Pages comes in. All is fine and well, it works locally, and I commit the code - and it doesn't
      work in production. A quick Google Search tells me that GitHub Pages <i>cannot handle GET and PUT requests.</i> A TRAGEDY!</p>
      <p>Was it all for naught? Potentially. Even if I did not get to actually implement it, what a fun project it was! It really makes
      me think about what kind of websites I actually can create for myself, should I want to ever pay for a non-static website. I most
      likely would want a website with a more aesthetically-pleasing implementation of my LastFM data - maybe even an embedded website
      displaying some interesting visualization from another website; maybe I will add some kind of nice visuals of my own, perhaps a photo
      gallery? Who knows what the future holds!</p>

      <h2>Retractable Poi</h2>
      <h4>Spring 2020</h4>
      <p>During Spring of 2020, I took a Computer Graphics and Design course, which
        was retrospectively one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. I have
        worked with CAD a lot over the years for various projects, but I have never
        had any formal training. Taught by Dr. Yesilevskiy, I learned valuable skills
        for modeling all sorts of objects and I got hands-on experience that
        still helps me to this day.
      </p>
      <p>The best part of this class was the final project, where we were simply told
        to "find a problem in the world and fix it" with some kind of product.
        I decided to focus on the flow arts, a subset of performing arts that
         uses props that are swung, thrown, or spun. I more specifically focused on poi,
         which are at a very basic level balls on strings that can be spun or thrown.
      </p>
      <p>Because typical poi spinners perform in often weird locations, it is a common
        problem that they get lost or stolen, and because they are usually very expensive
        (a pair of programmable LED poi can cost upwards of $220 USD), it can cause
        financial burden on the spinner. I decided to remedy this problem by making
        retractable poi that can be worn on the arm, then extended during spinning,
        and then retracted later. It was a challenge to model, especially modeling
        fabric, but it ended up being a product I was very proud of!

        function, check out my proposal <a href="misc_projects/CAD Final Project Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

        check out my GrabCAD here. Below is the (admittedly very not-serious)
        pitch video that we were also tasked with creating!
