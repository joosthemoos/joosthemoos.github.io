    <h1>Coding</h1>
    <p>Although I started coding HTML websites when I was in elementary school,
    I took an extended break pretty much until the end of high school, when I
    rediscovered my love for computer science and how easily applicable it is
    to other things that I love. Now I have mildly more impressive projects
    (I hope) than simply being able to Inspect-Element the Google homepage.</p>
