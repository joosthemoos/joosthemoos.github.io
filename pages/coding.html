    <p>Although I started coding HTML websites when I was in elementary school,
    I took an extended break pretty much until the end of high school, when I
    rediscovered my love for computer science and how easily applicable it is
    to other things that I love. Now I have mildly more impressive projects
    (I hope) than simply being able to Inspect-Element the Google homepage. Fun fact:
    this website was built by me from scratch as well!</p>

      <h2>Pronoun Checker</h2>
      <h4>Jan. 2020 (ongoing)</h4>
      <p>Sometime in January I started getting annoyed that I wasn't always getting my
        friends' pronouns correct, so I thought of methods to be able to correct myself
        so that after some practice on my own I could respect people's pronouns.
      </p>
      <p>The result was this very basic pronoun checker (which is still in the works).
        It uses the Python speech_recognition library and NLTK to be able to read in the
        speaker's input sentence with a proper name, and then it searches for a correct
        pronoun in the second sentence.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, it only works with male and female pronouns that are inputted in two
        .txt files. The issue is that it cannot deal with uncertainty such as gender-neutral
        names or rarer names. The ever-present issue of coreference resolution is also still there,
        and at the time I did not understand that determining if the pronoun related to the noun is
        actually a more difficult problem than I thought it was.

      <h2>Brickbreaker</h2>
      <h4>Summer 2019</h4>
      <p>As part of the introductory Python class I took at Stanford University,
        one of our projects was to create a Brickbreaker game using their proprietary
        GUI packages. The result is a fun game!<br><br>
