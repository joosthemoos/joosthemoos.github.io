    <p>I am a pretty big space fan and I enjoy doing various projects relating
    to aerospace. I also have a lot of opinions about the commercial aerospace
    industry specifically, so I guess they might pop up on here once in a while.</p>

      <p>During the first year of the pandemic, I had the pleasure of working with the
      folks over at Quantum Numerics AG in Germany as a Research and Development Intern.
      There, I had a great time gaining exposure to GPU processing and optimization,
      physics modeling, and visualization. I especially loved working with DeckGL for the
      first time, modeling space debris and building a small applet that could host my own
      visualization of all debris in our atmosphere under 2cm! I cannot share much more than
      this of course, but here is the picture I created! It was created with a DeckGL Point-Cloud
      Layer that also was interactive, where you could mouse over the point in order to read
      information about the piece of debris at that location, if available. Many thanks again
      to the team at Quantum Numerics AG for the first internship that I have ever had!</p>

      <h2>I am a Brooke Owens Fellow!</h2>
      <h4>Fall 2020 - Spring 2021</h4>
      <p>I am so happy to be able to finally announce that I am a Brooke
      Owens Fellow for the Class of 2021! The application process was unlike anything
      that I have gone through before, with many essays (and the video on my About page)
      submitted, multiple interviews with companies and Fellows, and generally much
      anxiety throughout the entire Fall semester.</p>
      <p>My host company is Planet Labs, a company which I have been personally a huge
        fan of ever since I have gotten into learning about and keeping up with the
        aerospace industry. The work that is being done on their end, in terms of high-quality
        satellites, imaging, and processing is among the best in the satellite industry as a
        whole and I am so excited to be able to go to San Francisco this summer and see what
        it is all about. I will be working on the Mission Operations team, most likely doing
        work that I have never done before, and I am looking forward to the learning experience
        that it will bring.</p>
      <p>I am also very grateful for the amazing women and gender minorities that the Brooke Owens
        Fellowship brings together. Everyone I have met so far is so smart, so kind, and it very much
        amazes me how many people are out there that enjoy aerospace. Columbia University does not have
        an Aerospace Engineering degree or track, so outside of the Columbia Space Initiative I do not get
        to interact with many people who enjoy aerospace as much as I do. I hope that by being surrounded
        by all of these wonderful people I can learn a bit about what they are doing and about aerospace
        as a whole!</p>

        <h2>Redesigned <i>Mercury</i> Comms Display</h2>
        <h4>Fall 2020</h4>
        <p>As part of the Aerospace Human Factors Engineering course, taught by
          Prof. Mike Massimino (our resident astronaut and cool guy), our goal for
           the course was to work on redesigning a subsystem of the <i>Mercury</i> spacecraft.
           For what it's worth, the <i>Mercury</i> spacecraft was not very-well designed,
           and technology has advanced in almost every field such that many of the
           systems they had at the time could be rendered obsolete.</p>

        <p> My partner Henry Manelski and I chose to redesign the communications display.
          Several problems with the initial communications system were that it
          relied on ground stations for connection (which resulted in frequent
          blackouts), it did not warn astronauts of approaching losses-of-signal
          or when they would acquire it, and knowing whether the audio/telemetry
          sending was on or off was anyone's guess. It was also not clear whether
          the audio was off due to a scheduled blackout or a system malfunction.</p>

        <p> Our solution was to revamp the display to include color-coded indicators
          for various system states, as well as countdowns until LOS and AOS. The
          issue of frequent blackouts is solved at a system level, wherein the
          audio signal connects to geostationary TDRSS satellites which have
          long been the standard of communication in space. </p>
          <p>

            This space display demo uses tkinter and Pillow. The colors of the indicators are as follows:
            <li> Green: audio/telemetry transmitting as normal
            <li> Yellow: audio is manually turned off by operator
            <li> Turquoise: audio/telemetry not sending due to a scheduled blackout
            <li> Red: audio/telemetry not sending due to a systems failure
        </p>

        <p> As part of our project, we also had to design a human factors-focused
          experiment in order to test the usability and workload of the system. So,
          we created Modified Cooper-Harper Scales in order to determine the effectiveness of the system.</p>

        <p> If you would like to read more about the initial design and how our analysis went, our final paper can be found <a href="space_projects/AHFE - Group 4 Final Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
