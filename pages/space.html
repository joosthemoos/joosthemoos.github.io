    <p>I am a pretty big space fan and I enjoy doing various projects relating
    to aerospace. I also have a lot of opinions about the commercial aerospace
    industry specifically, so I guess they might pop up on here once in a while.</p>

        <h2>Redesigned <i>Mercury</i> Comms Display</h2>
        <h4>Fall 2020</h4>
        <p>As part of the Aerospace Human Factors Engineering course, taught by
          Prof. Mike Massimino (our resident astronaut and cool guy), our goal for
           the course was to work on redesigning a subsystem of the <i>Mercury</i> spacecraft.
           For what it's worth, the <i>Mercury</i> spacecraft was not very-well designed,
           and technology has advanced in almost every field such that many of the
           systems they had at the time could be rendered obsolete.</p>

        <p> My partner Henry Manelski and I chose to redesign the communications display.
          Several problems with the initial communications system were that it
          relied on ground stations for connection (which resulted in frequent
          blackouts), it did not warn astronauts of approaching losses-of-signal
          or when they would acquire it, and knowing whether the audio/telemetry
          sending was on or off was anyone's guess. It was also not clear whether
          the audio was off due to a scheduled blackout or a system malfunction.</p>

        <p> Our solution was to revamp the display to include color-coded indicators
          for various system states, as well as countdowns until LOS and AOS. The
          issue of frequent blackouts is solved at a system level, wherein the
          audio signal connects to geostationary TDRSS satellites which have
          long been the standard of communication in space. </p>

            This space display demo uses tkinter and Pillow. The colors of the indicators are as follows:
            <li> Green: audio/telemetry transmitting as normal
            <li> Yellow: audio is manually turned off by operator
            <li> Turquoise: audio/telemetry not sending due to a scheduled blackout
            <li> Red: audio/telemetry not sending due to a systems failure
        </p>

        <p> As part of our project, we also had to design a human factors-focused
          experiment in order to test the usability and workload of the system. So,
          we created Modified Cooper-Harper Scales in order to determine the effectiveness of the system.</p>

        <p> If you would like to read more about the initial design and how our analysis went, our final paper can be found <a href="space_projects/AHFE - Group 4 Final Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
